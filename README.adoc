== Important Notes

. What is a security: Security is for *_protecting your data and business logic_*  inside your applications

. Security is a NoN FuN ReQ: Security is a similar to scalability, performance and availability, no client will specifically ask that "Hey I need security"

. Security from DEV phase: Security *_should_* be considered right from development phase itself along with business logic

. Kinds of Security: For web apps we can implement security in different ways such as HTTPS, SSL, Authentication, Authorization etc

. So why security is important: Security doesn't mean only loosing data or money by also image and brand and course trust from your users, which you have built over years

. Avoid Common attacks: With security, we should also avoid most common security attacks like CSRF, Broken Authentication inside our app

. Spring Security supports various standards of security to implement authentication, like using username/password authentication, JWT tokens, OAuth2, OpenID etc

.Spring Security Internal Flow
image::thumbs/spring_security_internal_flow.png[]

* Each filter has your own responsibility and feature

* Spring Security Filters: are a series of filters that intercept each request & work together to identify if Authentication is required or not.
If authentication is required, accordingly navigate the user to a login (default) page or use the existing details stored during initial authentication

* Authentication: are filters like _UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter_ will extract username/password from HTTP request & prepare _an Authentication_ type object, _Because Authentication_ is core standard of storing authenticated user details inside _Spring Security framework_

* AuthenticationManager: Once received request from filter, it delegates the validating of the user details to the authentication providers available.
Since there can be multiple providers inside app, it is the responsibility of the AuthenticationManager to manage all the authentication providers available

* AuthenticationProvider: AuthenticationProviders has all the core logic of validating u ser details for authentication

* UserDetailsManager/UserDetailsService: helps in retrieving, creating, updating and deleting the User Details from the DB/storage systems.

* PasswordEncoder: Service interface helps in encoding and hashing passwords.
Otherwise, we way have to live with plan text password

* SecurityContext: Once the request has been authenticated, the authentication will usually be stored in a thread-local SecurityContext managed by the SecurityContextHolder. this help during the upcoming requests from the same user

----

* By default, Spring Security, protects all the paths present inside the web application.
This behavior is due to the code present inside the method _defaultSecurityFilterSecurityChain of class SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration_

.SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration Sample
[source,java]
----
class SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration {
  @Bean
  @Order(SecurityProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER)
  SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterSecurityChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeHttpRequests().anyRequest().authenticated(); // all the paths must be authenticated by default
    http.formLogin();
    http.httpBasic();
    return http.build();
  }
}
----

* Lambda DSL style will replace the traditional methods

.UserDetailsService/Manager main Structure

----
getAuthorities()

getUsername()
isAccountNonExpired()
isAccountNonLocked()
isCredentialsNonExpired()

----

.User class, the core implementation of UserDetails functionalities
[source,java]

----
createUser(UserDetails user){}

changePassword(String oldPwd, String newPwd) {}
userExists(String username) {}
----

==== Authentication vs UserDetails

* Authentication is a return type in all the scenarios where we are trying to determine of the authentication is successful or not.
Like aside the _AuthenticationProvider & AuthenticationManager_;

[source,html]
----
getName()
getPrincipal()
getAuthorities()
getCredentials()
getDetails()
isAuthenticated()
setAuthenticated()
eraseCredentials()
----

* UserDetails is the return type in all the scenarios where we try to load the user info from a storage system.
Like inside the _UserDetailsService & UserDetailsManager_;

[source,html]
----
-
UserDetailsManager
-
changePassword()
createUser(UserDetails user)
deleteUser(String username)
updateUser(UserDetails user)
loadUserByUserName(String username)
updateUser()
-
InMemoryUserDetailsManager
-
...
----

=== Password Management

* Encoding is defined as the process of just converting data from one form to another and *_has nothing to do with cryptography_*, it involves not secret and is completely reversible, never ever used encoded to protect data, and the most common usages of encoding are BASE64, ASCII, UNICODE https://www.base64encode.org/[Base Encode]

* Encryption is defined as the process of transforming data in such a way that guarantees confidentiality; this requires the use of a secret which, in cryptographic terms is called as _key_, we can reverse the cipher data using decryption using the key https://bcrypt-generator.com/[Bcrypt-Generator]

* Hashing is another data conversion to the hash value using hash functions, when data is hashed is non-convertible, one cannot determine the original data from a hash value generated, the match with arbitrary data can be verified whether this data matches based on input and output - https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html[Hash sha256]

[source,java]
----
// DaoAuthenticatorProvider.java
// additionalAuthenticationChecks...PasswordEncoder
interface PasswordEncoder {
  String encode(CharSequence rawPassword);
  boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword);
  default boolean upgradeEncoding(String encodedPassword) { return false; }
}

// not recommended to use in prod
class NoOpPasswordEncoder implements PasswordEncoder{
  // deal with passwords in plaintext
}
// not recommended to use in prod
class StandardPasswordEncoder implements PasswordEncoder{
  // just to support legacy apps
}
// not recommended to use in prod

=== CORS & CSRF

. CSRF - cross-site request forgery
. CORS - cross-origin resource sharing

[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
  "mobileNumber": "2233121",
  "pwd": "welcome1",
  "role": "user"
}
----

=== CORS

. CORS is a protocol that enables scripts running on a browser client to interact with resources from a different origin.
Other origins means the URL being accessed differs from the location that JS is running

* _@CrossOrigin(origins = "*" or "http://host") in Spring security can be used_, but it is not recommended to put this config in a specific class

* CSRF, cross-site forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attack aims to perform an operation in a web app on behalf of a user without their explicit consent; the best way to avoid this attack is to generate a random token csrf, by default Spring Security block all http operations with error 403, if there is no CSRF solution implemented inside a web app.

.Authentication & Authorization
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Authentication |Authorization

|In authentication, the identity of users is checked for providing access to the system
|In authorization, person's or user's authorities are checked for accessing the resources

|Authentication (AuthN) done before Authorization
|Authorization (AuthZ) always happens after authentication

|It usually needs user's login details
|It needs user's privilege or roles

|If authentication fails, usually we will get 401 error response
|If authorization fails, usually we will get 403 error response

|For a sample as a Bank customer/employee in order to perform actions in the app, we need to prove our identity
|Once logged into the application, my roles, authorities will decide what kind of actions I can do

|===

=== How Authorities are stored

. Authorities/Roles information is Spring Security is stored inside GrantedAuthority

[source,java]
----
interface GrantedAuthority {
  String getAuthority();
}
class SimpleGrantedAuthority implements GrantedAuthority {
  final String role;
  String getAuthority() {}
}

// Authority Control
  /*.requestMatchers("/myAccount").hasRole("USER")
                    .requestMatchers("/myBalance").hasAnyRole("USER","ADMIN")
                    .requestMatchers("/myLoans").hasRole("USER")
                    .requestMatchers("/myCards").hasRole("USER")
                    .requestMatchers("/user").authenticated()*/

----

* ROLE_ is automatically provisioned by Spring

.Spring Security using Role Concept
image::thumbs/spring_security_hasRole.png[]

=== Servlets & Filters

* Filters inside Java web apps can be used to intercept each request/response and do some pre work before our business logic.
* We can use housekeeping activities during the authentication and authorization flow
** Input validation
** Tracing, Auditing and reporting
** Logging of input like IP Address etc.
** Encryption and Decryption
** Multi factor authentication using OTP
** _ServletRequest_ can be used to retrieve details about the request
** _ServletResponse_ can be used to modify the response before sending it back to a client
** _FilterChain_ represents a collection of filters with a defined order in which they can act, we can use _FilterChain_ object to forward the request to the next filter in the chain.

[source,java]
----
// NOT RECOMMENDED TO PRODUCTION
// Enable the debugging of security details
@EnableWebSecurity(debug=true)
class MySecurityFilter {}
// or properties
//logging.level.org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy=DEBUG
----

=== Token-based Authentication with JWT

* _JSESSIONID_ tokens have some disadvantages such they haven't your custom metadata, they're stored inside your browser tied in a cookie

* Roles of Token: tokens can be a plain string with an uuid, or it can usually be of type JSON Web Token _(JWT)_ that get generated when the user is authenticated for the first time, every request to a restricted resource, the client needs to send the access token in the query string or Authorization header, the server then validates the token and, if it's valid, return the secure resource to the client

* Tokens help us to not share the credentials for every request
* Tokens can be invalidated during any suspicious activities w
* Tokens can be created with a short lifespan
* Tokens can be used to store user-related information like roles/authorities
* Tokens can keep re-usability over multiple platforms and domains
* Stateless and easier to scale
* JWT tokens have 3 parts (header, payload, signature) each one separated by a dot (.), bellow a jwt sample
** header stores metadata/info related to the token, such algorithm that generates the signature
** payload stores details related to user, roles etc, which can be used later for AuthN and AuthZ, we always try to keep the jwt light as possible
** signature is an optional part, but if when you share the JWT in an internal scenario, when you trust in caller, never in an open web, this is the guarantee that no one tampered our token
** Sample of signature can be using, e.g; HMAC SHA256 algorithm, is #_HMACHSA246(base64UrlEncoded(header) + "." + base64UrlEncoded(payload), secret)_#, the signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also to be verified that the sender os the jwt is who it says it is;

=== Method Level Security

* Method level security allows to apply the authorization rules any layer of an application like in service layer or repository layer, it can be enabled by _@EnableWebMethodSecurity_

* We can use method level security will also help authorization rules even in the non-web apps where we will not have any endpoints, they are classified as

. Invocation authorization
. Filtering authorization

[source,java]
----
@Service
class MyProtectedResource {
  @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('VIEWPOJO')")
  @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
  @PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")
  @PreAuthorize("# username == authentication.principal.username")
  @PostAuthorize("returnObject.username == authentication.principal.username")
  @PostAuthorize("hasPermission(returnObject, 'ADMIN'")
  public MyPojo getPojo(String param) {
    return param;
  }
}
----

=== OAUTH 2

* In enterprise apps, security concerns must be live in a separated component

* Temporary Token loaded with permissions is provided based on credentials

.OAuth2 Flow
image::thumbs/oauth2flow.png[]

* Steps 2 & 3, where a client is making a request to Auth Server

. _client_id_: the id which identifies the client app by the *Auth Server*, this will be grated when the client registers first time with auth server
. _redirect_uri_: the URI value which the _auth server_ needs to redirect post successful authentication
. _scope_: similar to authorities, specifies level of access that client is request
. _state_: CSRF token value to protected from CSRF attacks
. _response_type_: with the value 'code' which indicates that we want to follow authorization code grant

* Step 5 where a client received an authorization code from auth server

. _code_: the authorization code received from the above steps
. _client_id & client_secret_: the client credentials which are registered with the auth server
. _grant_type_: with the value 'authorization_code' which identifies the kind of grant type is used

* Some auth flows

. Authorization Code
. PKCE
. Client Credentials
. Device Code
. Refresh Token
. Implicit Flow (Legacy isn't recommended for production)
. Password Grant (Legacy isn't recommended for product)

* OpenID Connect is a protocol that sits on top of OAuth 2.0 framework OAuth 2.0 provides authorization via an access token containing scopes, OpenID Connect provides authentication by introducing a new ID which contains a new set of information and claims spec for identity

=== OAUTH2 and KeyCloak

.OAuth2 KeyCloak Flow
image::thumbs/authserver-flow.png[]

* A client app needs access protected server resources they need to get an access token from _Auth Servers_, once the access token is received from Auth Server, the client app will connect on resource server along with the token, the resource server will connect with auth server to know the validity of the access token and if it is valid, the resource server will enable it to the client app

.KeyCloak Docker version

----
docker run -d -p 8086:8080 --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:22.0.3 start-dev
----

* Ream is a space to organizer own users, roles and clients, they are always in a boundary, different environments must have different credentials

.OAuth2 KeyCloak basic flow
image::thumbs/oauth-keycloak-basic-flow.png[]


image::thumbs/clientid-conf.png[]

* On the image up above, we're disabling the standard flow because it is a standard OpenID Connect redirect based authentication with authorization code.
In terms of OpenID Connect or OAuth2 specifications, this enables support of 'Authorization Code Flow' for this client.

=== OAuth2 Auth Code Flow with proof for code exchange (PKCE)

* When public clients (e.g native or spa apps) request access tokens, some additional security concerns are posed that are not mitigated, by the AuthZ Code Flow alone, is because clients cannot securely store a Client Secret, but with #*_PKCE-enhanced_*# Authorization Code follow the steps:

. Once user clicks login, client app creates a cryptographically random code_verifier add from this generates a code_challenge
. Code challenge is a Base64-URL-encoded string of SHA256 hash of the code verifier, that redirects the user to the Authorization Server along with de code_challenge
. Authorization Server stores the code_challenge and redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code, which is good for one use
. Client App sends the authorization code and the code_verifier (create in step 1) to the authorization server
. Authorization server verifies the code_challenge and _code_verifier_, if it is valid it responds with ID Token and Access Token (and optionally a Refresh token)
