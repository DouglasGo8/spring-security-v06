== Important Notes

. What is a security: Security is for *_protecting your data and business logic_*  inside your applications

. Security is a NoN FuN ReQ: Security is a similar to scalability, performance and availability, no client will specifically ask that "Hey I need security"

. Security from DEV phase: Security *_should_* be considered right from development phase itself along with business logic

. Kinds of Security: For web apps we can implement security in different ways such as HTTPS, SSL, Authentication, Authorization etc

. So why security is important: Security doesn't mean only loosing data or money by also image and brand and course trust from your users, which you have built over years

. Avoid Common attacks: With security, we should also avoid most common security attacks like CSRF, Broken Authentication inside our app

. Spring Security supports various standards of security to implement authentication, like using username/password authentication, JWT tokens, OAuth2, OpenID etc

.Spring Security Internal Flow
image::thumbs/spring_security_internal_flow.png[]

* Each filter has your own responsibility and feature

* Spring Security Filters: are a series of filters that intercept each request & work together to identify if Authentication is required or not.
If authentication is required, accordingly navigate the user to a login (default) page or use the existing details stored during initial authentication

* Authentication: are filters like _UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter_ will extract username/password from HTTP request & prepare _an Authentication_ type object, _Because Authentication_ is core standard of storing authenticated user details inside _Spring Security framework_

* AuthenticationManager: Once received request from filter, it delegates the validating of the user details to the authentication providers available.
Since there can be multiple providers inside app, it is the responsibility of the AuthenticationManager to manage all the authentication providers available

* AuthenticationProvider: AuthenticationProviders has all the core logic of validating u ser details for authentication

* UserDetailsManager/UserDetailsService: helps in retrieving, creating, updating and deleting the User Details from the DB/storage systems.

* PasswordEncoder: Service interface helps in encoding and hashing passwords.
Otherwise, we way have to live with plan text password

* SecurityContext: Once the request has been authenticated, the authentication will usually be stored in a thread-local SecurityContext managed by the SecurityContextHolder. this help during the upcoming requests from the same user

.Spring Security Internal flow in steps in an authentication scenario
[source,java]
----

// step.1
class AuthorizationFilter extends GenericFilterBean {
  // ....
  void doFilter() {}
}
// step.2
class DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter {}
// step.3
class UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken extends AbstractAuthenticationToken {
  void authenticate(){}
}
// step.4
class ProviderManager {
  void authenticate(){}
}
// step.5
class DaoAuthenticationProvider extends AbstratUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider {}
----

*_JSESSIONID_* to ensure security per request stored in the same tampered op over cookie

=== Commands over Resources

[source,bash]
----
curl -v http://localhost:8080/greet -u "guest:welcome1"
curl -v http://localhost:8080/myAccount -u "guest:welcome1"
curl -v http://localhost:8080/myAccount -u "johndb@mail.com:12345"
# With Base64 Encoded credentials
curl -v http://localhost:8080/greet -H "Authorization: Basic Z3Vlc3Q6d2VsY29tZTE="
#
curl -v http://localhost:8080/greet -H "Authorization: Basic am9obmRiQG1haWwuY29tOjEyMzQ1"
----

* By default, Spring Security, protects all the paths present inside the web application.
This behavior is due to the code present inside the method _defaultSecurityFilterSecurityChain of class SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration_

.SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration Sample
[source,java]
----
class SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration {
  @Bean
  @Order(SecurityProperties.BASIC_AUTH_ORDER)
  SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterSecurityChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeHttpRequests().anyRequest().authenticated(); // all the paths must be authenticated by default
    http.formLogin();
    http.httpBasic();
    return http.build();
  }
}
----

* Lambda DSL style will replace the traditional methods

.UserDetailsService/Manager main Structure

.UserDetails
[source,html]
----
getAuthorities()
getPassword()
getUsername()
isAccountNonExpired()
isAccountNonLocked()
isCredentialsNonExpired()
isEnabled()
----

.User class, the core implementation of UserDetails functionalities
[source,java]
----
class User implements UserDetails, CredentialsContainer {}
----

.UserDetailsService Interface
[source,html]
----
loadUserByUsername(String username)
----

.UserDetailsManager Interface
[source,html]
----
createUser(UserDetails user){}
updateUser(UserDetails user) {}
deleteUser(String username) {}
changePassword(String oldPwd, String newPwd) {}
userExists(String username) {}
----

==== Authentication vs UserDetails

* Authentication is a return type in all the scenarios where we are trying to determine of the authentication is successful or not.
Like aside the _AuthenticationProvider & AuthenticationManager_;

[source,html]
----
getName()
getPrincipal()
getAuthorities()
getCredentials()
getDetails()
isAuthenticated()
setAuthenticated()
eraseCredentials()
----

* UserDetails is the return type in all the scenarios where we try to load the user info from a storage system.
Like inside the _UserDetailsService & UserDetailsManager_;

[source,html]
----
-
UserDetailsManager
-
changePassword()
createUser(UserDetails user)
deleteUser(String username)
updateUser(UserDetails user)
loadUserByUserName(String username)
updateUser()
-
InMemoryUserDetailsManager
-
...

=== Password Management

* Encoding is defined as the process of just converting data from one form to another and *_has nothing to do with cryptography_*, it involves not secret and is completely reversible, never ever used encoded to protect data, and the most common usages of encoding are BASE64, ASCII, UNICODE https://www.base64encode.org/[Base Encode]

* Encryption is defined as the process of transforming data in such a way that guarantees confidentiality; this requires the use of a secret which, in cryptographic terms is called as _key_, we can reverse the cipher data using decryption using the key https://bcrypt-generator.com/[Bcrypt-Generator]

* Hashing is another data conversion to the hash value using hash functions, when data is hashed is non-convertible, one cannot determine the original data from a hash value generated, the match with arbitrary data can be verified whether this data matches based on input and output - https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html[Hash sha256]
